    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p><img src="tutorial/play-example-form-homepage.png" width="100%"/></p>

    <p>This application provides an example of form processing with the following features:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Play Version 2.2</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.webjars.org/" target="_blank">WebJars</a> to download dependencies.</li>
        <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.0</a>.</li>
        <li>Individual Twitter Bootstrap <a href="#code/app/views/bootstrap3" class="shortcut">helper templates</a> for each form control.</li>
        <li>Separation of <a href="#code/app/views/formdata" class="shortcut">form backing classes</a> from <a href="#code/app/models" class="shortcut">model classes</a>.</li>
        <li>Validation done with <a href="#code/app/views/formdata/StudentFormData.java" class="shortcut">validate()</a>, not annotations.</li>
        <li>Testing with <a href="https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium" target="_blank">Fluentlenium</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The design of this example differs in two significant ways from the traditional Play form processing examples. </p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Distinct model and form classes.</strong>  Most examples of form processing in Play "overload" the
            model classes to serve two tasks:  (1) specify the database schema structure; and
            (2) provide the "backing class" for forms.  Requiring a single class to perform these two tasks
            appears to work well only when the models and forms are both simple and similar in structure. In this example system, the
            <a href="#code/app/views/formdata" class="shortcut">views.formdata package</a> provides
            classes for form processing, and the <a href="#code/app/models" class="shortcut">models package</a> provides
            classes for database schemas. Since Play requires the backing classes for forms to have public fields,
            this separation means that model classes can have private fields, avoiding <a href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/thread.jspa?messageID=143570&amp;#143570" target="_blank">well documented problems</a>. </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Explicit field constructors for Twitter Bootstrap 3.x.</strong>  The canonical recommendation by Play developers for users of
            Twitter Bootstrap is to create a single "implicit" field constructor.  The problem with this recommendation
            is that a single implicit field constructor cannot satisfy all of Twitter Bootstrap's layout
            requirements for form controls (for example, multiple checkboxes). This example illustrates
            a more general solution in which normal (i.e. "explicit") scala templates (i.e. field constructors) are defined in the
            <a href="#code/app/views/bootstrap3" class="shortcut">views.bootstrap3 package</a> for each of the Twitter Bootstrap controls. IMHO, the
            code is significantly easier to understand and debug for Java-based Play framework users.  </p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps to understanding the system</h2>

    <p><strong>Run the application.</strong></p>

    <p>Open <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> and after the application is compiled it will be automatically started.  You can then open <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a> in your browser. To display the single form illustrated at the top of this page. The form displays the fields associated with a "Student":  Name, Password, Hobbies, Level, GPA, and Majors.  Some of these are required, some are optional. Try filling out the form in both valid and invalid ways and pressing Submit to see what happens.</p>

    <p>When you submit a valid version of the form, the system will redisplay the form with exactly the
        same data that you entered, and also show a representation of the Student model instance
        created from the form values.</p>

    <p><strong>Run the tests.</strong></p>

    <p>The tests will automatically run and you can see the results by navigating to <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> in Activator.</p>

    <p>We'll come back to this later, but this step verifies that tests run correctly in your environment.</p>

    <p><strong>Review the controllers.</strong></p>

    <p>Now review the controller class. <a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.java" class="shortcut">Application</a>
        has just two methods: getIndex() which displays the form in the index page and postIndex() that processes a form submission
        from the index page. See the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file for how this is wired up.</p>

    <p>The getIndex method takes a Student ID as a parameter. If the value is 0, then an empty form is
        displayed, otherwise the form is displayed pre-filled with the data associated with the Student ID.
        For example, you can retrieve the data for the student with ID 1 using: http://localhost:9000/?id=1.
        The system <a href="#code/app/models/Student.java" class="shortcut">instantiates a couple of students on startup</a>. </p>

    <p>By looking at the controller, you can see the basic approach for either form display (HTTP GET) or
        form submission (HTTP POST):</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>An instance of StudentFormData is passed to the templates for rendering. This class has public
            fields as required by Play, and they are all String or List[String] because binding only works on strings.</p></li>
        <li><p>Other component entities (Hobby, GradeLevel, GradePointAverage, Major) provide helper methods
            to support display of their values as strings along with the student's current value(s) for
            those components.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <a href="#code/app/models/Student.java" class="shortcut">Student.makeInstance</a> and <a href="#code/app/models/Student.java"  class="shortcut">Student.makeStudentFormData</a>
            methods provide conversion between the form data and model representations of a Student.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Review the models.</strong></p>

    <p>Skim through the <a href="#code/app/models" class="shortcut">models package</a>.
        There should be no surprises; it parallels the form pretty closely.  Some things to note:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>A Student entity contains non-primitive, complex components such as a list of Hobby entities and a list of Major entities.</p></li>
        <li><p>The models have private fields and getters/setters. (Sorry, I'm old school that way.)     </p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Review the views.</strong></p>

    <p>The <a href="#code/app/views" class="shortcut">views package</a>
        is where things get most interesting.   The <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main</a>
        and <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index</a>
        templates are pretty much what you'd expect. </p>

    <p>Note that the main template shows how to import JQuery in case you want to use Bootstrap Javascript components.</p>

    <p>The second thing to review is the <a href="#code/app/views/bootstrap3" class="shortcut">views.bootstrap3</a>
        subpackage, containing Bootstrap 3 Scala templates for various form controls. Kudos to <a href="https://github.com/kaeawc" target="_blank">Jason
            Pearson</a> to writing these templates and making other helpful changes.</p>

    <p>Finally, the <a href="#code/app/views/formdata" class="shortcut">views.formdata</a>
        subpackage contains the single backing class (<a href="#code/app/views/formdata/StudentFormData.java" class="shortcut">StudentFormData</a>) required for this application.
        Note that the backing class consists of public fields containing the String data to be displayed/bound in the form,
        as well as a validate() method that determines if the submitted form data is valid or not.</p>

    <p><strong>Review the tests.</strong></p>

    <p>Testing is pretty straightforward, uses <a href="https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium#what-is-fluentlenium-" target="_blank">Fluentlenium</a>, and implements the
        <a href="https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium/wiki/Page-Object-Pattern" target="_blank">page object pattern</a>.</p>

    <p>Start by looking at <a href="#code/test/tests/pages/IndexPage.java" class="shortcut">IndexPage</a>.
        This class implements a bunch of methods to fill out the form and check to see whether the
        displayed form contains a success or error message. Note that most of these methods depend upon
        finding an HTML element with a specific ID, and so the Bootstrap Scala templates need to make
        sure these ID fields are set correctly.</p>

    <p>The actual test code is in <a href="#code/test/tests/ViewTest.java" class="shortcut">ViewTest</a>.
        There are four tests: one that just checks that we can retrieve the page, one that tests that
        submitting an empty form generates a validation error, one that submits a form filled out
        from a valid Student ID, and a final one that fills out a valid form manually by using the
        IndexPage methods. </p>

    <p>Getting tests to work exposes an unfortunate library versioning issue: <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">HTMLUnit</a> requires
        a version of JQuery no later than 1.8.3, while recent versions of Twitter Bootstrap
        have a Maven dependency of JQuery 1.9.0.  <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>
        illustrates how to load a newer version of Bootstrap with an older, HTMLUnit-compliant version of JQuery.
        Another solution is to use <a href="http://phantomjs.org/" target="_blank">PhantomJS</a> rather than HTMLUnit; then you can
        use current versions of JQuery. <a href="https://github.com/buster84/play-example-form" target="_blank">This fork</a> shows how to use PhantomJS.</p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>

    <p>While this code works and is pretty easy to understand, there are at least two design problems with it
        that I can see:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Verbosity.</strong>  It's kind of a drag to have two representations for a Student, one as a model and
            one as a backing class for forms.   I know that I presented this as a feature, but at the end
            of the day it's born of necessity.  Perhaps there exists an elegant way to implement composite entities
            (i.e. a Student that contains a List of Hobbies) in which display, binding, and validation
            can be done easily and understandably with a single class.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Integrity.</strong>  The code provides validation in the StudentFormData class, and certain
            methods (such as Student.makeInstance) must assume that they are being passed a valid
            StudentFormData instance.  That kind of assumption is worrisome, and annotation-based
            constraints could avoid it.  Annotation-based constraints also offer the potential
            to simultaneously apply to both the database model and the form validation, which would be really
            nice.  As a first step, I played around for a while with <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.0/JavaForms" target="_blank">Custom Data Binding</a>,
            but could not get it to work correctly for lists of Hobbies.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you see ways to solve these problems, please feel free to fork this code and implement your changes. </p>

    <p><em>Note that the following screencast documents a previous version of this system which used Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 and Play 2.1.  While the templates in the bootstrap3 package
        have been rewritten, the rest of the system remains unchanged.</em></p>
